If you're reading this, you've either stumbled upon here by accidentally interest to the American Language or you're here to actually do something.

Otherwise, this is the kiip video game project repo. I will be staging my cs, cpp, and h code in here for the eventual day that we can have a test product. Henry, if you're reading this, put whatever you have for the streams in here also.
